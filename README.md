# Nexum-Sidera

A futuristic browser prototype. Written in ClojureScript, utilizing electron and React.

Note: Electron says to not use it as browser. In this project I ignored those warnings for the sake of ease of development. Therefore, don't use this for anything serious.

## Development

1. Ensure that all JS dependencies are installed using `yarn install`.
2. Execute `yarn run watch` to install the clojure dependencies and start the ClojureScript compiler.
3. Execute `yarn run start:ui` to launch the electron app.
